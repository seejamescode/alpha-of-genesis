                        <h1>What</h1>
                        Alpha of Genesis is a web project that has the user experience the first chapter of Genesis while different visuals (including scientific theories) accompany the text.
                        <h1>Why</h1>
                        I had three goals out of this project:
                        <br>
                        - To help people read the first chapter of the Bible who had previously felt too intimidated to try
                        <br>
                        - To bend the misconception that a believer either exclusively chooses faith or science
                        <br>
                        - To just make something beautiful for God
                        <h1>Who</h1>
